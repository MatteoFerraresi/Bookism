# Bookism
Simple personal book archive/blog made with django.

frontend made with html, css, javascript.

Backend made with django. 

on your terminal, in the bookism directory, you can run the command python manage.py runserver to run a local server and see the site in action.
One can also go to \admin next to the url of the server and login to apply quick changes and add content.

On admin side you can change, delete and/or add new blog posts (books) with images, descriptions adn also adding a personal url for that post.

The problem is that the python command doesn't seem to recognize the manage.py file if it is not the original one in the first repository i created back in the day for the project.

hence as of right now you can't run the site
